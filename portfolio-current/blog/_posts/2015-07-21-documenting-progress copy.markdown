Progress can be hard to see or feel and sometimes, during a cursory glance back, it seems like it just hasn't happened at all. 
This is especially true if the starting point hasn't been documented. As a kid, I was a fervent supporter of documentation. Each summer, I would laboriously (and nerdily) put together a new edition of "Tanya's Summer Scrapbook". The scrapbooks contained all bits of information and relics from my summer. I saved newsletters, bookmarks, candy wrappers (i.e. trash) and pasted them in, took pictures of basically every trip that I went on, sketched graphs of how many times I rode each rollercoaster at each themepark (I went through a big rollercoaster fan phase), and wrote entries about my day to day activities (mostly orthodontic adventures). Probably, not surprisingly, I studied history and poured over others scrapbooks and documentation created long ago, learning the value of having a record, no matter how ephemeral or meaningless. I still resist the urge to save too much ephemera from my life, an attempt to save myself from becoming a crazy hoarder type later down the road. 

When building my portfolio, I realized I hadn't done much record keeping in my professional life. Yeah, I had comps and visual evidence of how my word had progressed, but I had never taken the time to really sit down and write about the context and what I had learned from each project. I suppose this is partly because I was forced to do this task so many times in school that I had come to see it as phony and partly because self-reflection and writing is an undervalued skill in the workplace; the tendency to "accomplish" one task and boogie right along to the next is way too prevalent, but how can we learn if we don't look back?

In September I'll celebrate one year in the working world as real life employee. Not much of this has been documented, so this is a place to start.
