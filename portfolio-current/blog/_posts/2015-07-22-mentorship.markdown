description: It's about the big picture.

Next month will mark my one year anniversary of being a real life designer. Before joining Priceline full time, I had gone through 7 years of college, studying history as an undergrad after which I slid right on into grad school where I studied UX design in an idealistic vacuume. Oh the difference between school and real life! 

In school, we had been taught to think about design holistically. Since it was an information studies program, specialised areas weren't addressed at all; rather we examined big picture issues such as: who would be using this product? what use cases would need to be supported? what currently exists? What specific need would this product satisfy etc. I arrived in my new position equipped with clear, step by step instructions of how to start a project and eager to implement them in real life only to find that...

...real life was nothing like school. (Shock! Confusion!) This wasn't the way design was approached at all. I was probably incredibly naive and hadn't really given it a thought about how things would be in the workplcae wilderness. Before graduating, I mostly worked in libraries with limited resources where digital projects were all owened by one person: me. In this setting, it was easy to go about things in an orderly fashion, keeping the big picture in mind, but in the complicated real world, this was hard to do. The "Big Picture" was something rarely brought up. In meetings people referred to specific pages and who "owned" them. The product path wasn't thought of in terms of how a user would experience it, but rather what made the most sense from an internal perspective. This made getting a sense of what was happening and where we were going really difficult. 

The nature of the work I was given further muddled things. A common practice is to give young designers small pieces of the pie, to test their skills in a controlled, scoped setting. Tasks given to me included simple things like adding messaging to a form or coming up with variations of a price box. For months I piddled away doing things like this, often over thinking them, wondering at times, if this was what design was like in the real world, a series of disjointed tasks with no context?

Eventually, I was put on a different team where I was given more robust tasks and encouraged to think about design changes and how they influenced the whole. One of the most important nuggets I received was when my mentor, Brian McCormack, told me, I wasn't working on the confirmation page, but the confirmation experience. "Whoa!" I thought, as my mental wheels started turning. Maybe the prescribed design changes were just the beginning? What else would be needed to build out the expirience? I realized that, as designers, it's our job to always keep an eye on the whole picture and see how we can take things to the next level. Sure, we'll have to do lots of small tasks along the way, but without keeping an eye to where things are going, you'll find yourself adrift and your product cobbled together. Even though this high-level thinking was what I was originally taught, it was easy to lose focus and find myself treading water in this sea of small tasks. 

This got me to thinking: if young designers eventually level up to become mid level and then senior designers, who is making sure their focus on the big picture is being nutured, especially considering the limited scope of projects often assigned to them? What if these limited tasks we are feeding to young designers is also limiting design thinking and incorrectly training them to examine pieces and not the whole? Maybe a key part of successfully sculpting a not-yet-fully formed designer is not seeing how they graduate from small to big tasks, but letting them tackle big tasks with guidance.
