					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Summary</h2>
					<p>
					The Priceline Styleguide is an ongoing project to create a living style guide and base.css for the Priceline.com desktop site that both designers and developers can reference. It’s a project I’ve been working on with <a href="www.brianfromnewyork.com">Brian McCormack<a/> since my days as an intern and has been a tremendous learning experience giving me hands on experience with creating design systems, solving scalability issues, writing efficient HTML & SCSS, and creating documentation and teaching materials. Along the way I've collaborated with designers, developers and project managers across the company and gained valuable insight into the different ways product development teams are constructed and operate. 
					Currently, the styleguide is built on Brad Frost’s <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Patternlab</a> and contains a library of common UI components around across the site. These common components make up the base.css which developers can use as a project starter just like Foundation or Bootstrap. For a detailed account of the project, keep reading! 


					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">The Problem</h2>
					<p>Priceline.com is a massive, multi-product site that has expanded organically and without a definitive styleguide for over a decade.  This created some inevitable problems for designers, developers and users. From a user perspective, the site’s inconsistent user interface delivered a disjointed and sometimes jarring experience that ultimately undermined user's trust. From a design perspective, there was no single reference to document how basic UI components should appear. To demonstrate this problem during an early audit, my colleague Brian found at least 12 different button styles running amok on the site! Without a styleguide to reference, designers across product teams had difficultly maintaining visual alignment. Similarly, without a global, base.css to reference, developers found themselves creating and referencing their own versions of base.css. Much development time was also spent re-coding common components over and over again. Additionally, without a standardized way to write HTML and CSS, existing code could not easily be shared between developer groups or products paths.

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Styleguide Goals</h2>
					<p>
					   <ul>
					 	<li>Create a consistent user experience</li>

					   <li> Provide a visual reference for common UI components and brand assets for designers and developers</li>
					   <li> Create one base.css for all projects to use as a starting point</li>
					   <li> Replace images and sprites with a font icon set to improve performance and consistency</li>
					   <li> Eliminate unnecessary development efforts by building modular components in HTML</li>
					   <li> Institute CSS class naming conventionst to allow for easy identifying, updating and sharing of components</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Building the Styleguide</h2>
					<p>To build the styleguide, Brian and I created a list of UI elements we felt should be documented. These elements were simple, common compoments found across the site such as buttons, pagination, breadcrumbs and tabs. Since there was no consistent style associated with any of these elements, we couldn't translate the existing designs into the styleguide. Additionally, many of the patterns we were using were aesthetically outdated and in need of a design refresh. 

				 	To tackle this, I worked through the list of UI elements, cataloging the styles that were currently used on the site and conducting competitive anaylsis. To give a concrete example, we'll look at site pagination.

				 	Many styles of pagination were found across prodcuts. I documented these in a Google Hangout. While this wasn't the ideal medium to share these, we had not started using InVision and it was a simple way to create a shareable collection that other designers could comment on. I then looked at other sites to see what sort of trends had emerged in pagination and how we could potentially make our pagination more useful. For instance, what if we could add additional functionality to the pagination to allow users more control over looking through results? Maybe allowing them to "view all" or enable them to easily jump to the first or last page of a result set. 

				 	Once I had a thorough understanding of all the contexts pagination is found, I started the design phase. After creating some intitial designs, I would share them at our weekly standup and get feedback from my fellow designers. Since my background is in user research and not UI design, I found this especially helpful in honing these skills. Looking back, my use of spacing was atrocious, especially on some of the earlier pagination designs (just look at it below. Uck). Another useful lesson I've learned throughout this process is that it's okay to present simple designs. Most of those early pagination attempts were too complicated; I felt that, as a new designer, presenting something simple would come across as lazy. I've learned that simple solutions are often the smartest places to start--it's harder to scale back than scale up. 


				 	Once a design was settled on, in this case a simple pagination, it was ready to code! I'm a firm believer that all designers should learn how to code. For me, creating a visual design is only part of the design process; without being involved in making it "real" the process seems incomplete. Knowing how my design will be constructed also helps me make more informed visual design decisions especially those regarding development effort and performance. Writing the HTML and SCSS for these compoments not only gave me the satisfaction of seeing them come to life, but helped me really refine my code writing. Since this code would be used in the base.css it was important to write all SCSS as efficiently as possible, abstracting patterns and using variables as much as possible. 
			
					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Future Styleguide</h2>
					<p>When the styleguide project started, mobile and desktop teams worked mostly independent of each other. As Priceline.com begins to explore responsive design, the line between desktop and mobile is increasingly blurred. While the two paths will remain separate for the foreseeable future, we are working on expanding our design system to include responsive patterns that will help establish conventions for these “in-between” responsive pages to ensure they align with both desktop and mobile styles and create a seamless user experience.</p>
