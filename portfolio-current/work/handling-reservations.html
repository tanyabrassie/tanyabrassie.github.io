					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Overview</h2>
					<p>In addition to my work on the styleguide, I’m responsible for making iterative design enhancements to Priceline’s responsive post-booking experience. The overall goal for these enhancements is to create a more robust user experience by building out self-service functionality while still finding ways to increase conversion without detracting from the experience. These changes to the confirmation pages for the air, hotels, rental car, and vacation packages vary in nature, scope and complexity: some are slight modifications to the visual design and content hierarchy, while others are changes to the existing user flow; however, all decisions are driven by data gathered from several sources including customer service calls and A/B testing. In addition to creating the designs, I also protoype and build them in HTML and SCSS, writing production ready code which is then passed over to the developers. If the design change requires altering a pre-existing portion of the page, I directly edit the code base. This creates an efficient workflow and improves communication between developers and designers which ultimately leads to a better product. Below are a few examples of specific projects that I've worked on to improve the post booking experience.</p>

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Cancellation Refinements</h2>
					<p> Recently, I've been working on making improvements to the cancellation experience for hotels and rental car. Currently, users who book a rental car can cancel at no charge. If a user has opted to add collision damage insurance to their reservation, this insurance is also fully refundable and cancelled automatically with the car reservation. 

					<h3 class="work__explanation__title">Issues with the Existing Experience</h3>
					Based on call volume data from customer service, we realized that there were several issues with the current cancellation experience. For one, customers were not aware if their collision damage insurance was cancelled along with their rental car information. Adding to the confusion was the fact that they Collision Damage Insurance module was still displayed on the cancellation page (#6 below), with no explicity messaging stating it had also been cancelled. Users also weren't sure if an email had been automatically sent to them (#2), or if they needed to send themselves a cancellation email. The "Email Itinerary" button (#3) added to this confusion: was a cancellation confirmation email sent? Do I need to send one to myself? If I click "Email Itinerary" will that send me a copy of my interiary or a cancellation notice? And while the summary of charges module clearly indicated the customer owed nothing towards the rental car reservation, the CDI refund information was presented quietly and the module lacked a clear content hierarchy (#5). Lastly, even though the trip was canceled, the app download banner across the top, encouraging the user to take William Shatner and Kaley Cucoco with them to Pittsburgh still appeared making the experience seem neglected (i.e. I'm clearly not going to Pittsburgh anymore, why are they still asking to come along?").</p>

					<p>Since the confirmation page is a responsive template, I had to consider solutions to these problems from a mobile-first perspective. Additionally, some issues (such as the lack of email notification) were common across all the products cancellation pages, so the solution needed to also incorporate both product scenarios while keeping consistency in mind. I also wanted to add some subtle personality to the page, to make it seem less austere and robotic. </p>
