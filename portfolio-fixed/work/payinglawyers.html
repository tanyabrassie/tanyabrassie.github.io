						<p> It's the year 2025 and Dwell Magazine has evolved! This project involved re-designing Dwell for future readers and consists of three cover designs, two front of the book layouts and one feature. 

						
						<p class='titlep'></p>
						<p>My Dwell re-design anticipates increased consumption of digital magazines by tablet users and uses the digital medium to engage users in ways traditioanl print magazines cannot. The digital Dwell magazine introduces motion to the reading experience! Instead of one gesture to nagivate through the magazine (the flipping of the page), the reader of digital Dwell is expected to navigate through the content, tapping and sliding to reveal pages and new information.</p>
						
						<p>Although many Dwell covers sport a contemporary look, they often appear cluttered and busy. The re-design strives for a more refined, deliberate and balanced aeshetic. The new copy is more self-aware and playful and at times, the subject of the cover is unexpected.</p>

						According to the Pew Research Center, voting turnout for youths is on a decline (ut oh). In an effort to encourage the youths to vote, I designed these Art-Deco style voting posters for my advanced visual design class.
						<br><br>
						The heavily geometric posters make use of a variety of art deco motifs such as sunbursts, zigzags and vivid colors to communicate a sense of urgency and alarm for what lies ahead if one does not choose to vote. Both posters reference Art Deco's optimism for the future, but display it with a distopian twist that is perhaps a bit more cynical and contemporary.

							For the Latin American Studies Department at the Univeristy of Texas, I designed and developed this digital archive for the Jose Maria Luis Mora collection. 
							
							The digital portal gives greater access to the archive's holdings and increases the findability of its documents. Following the tenets of archival practice, the architecture of the digital archive mimics the structure of the physical collection and therefore maintains archival integrity. Items can be located by browsing or using the search function. Users can also zoom in to examine documents and download items in PDF form.

						<a href="" data-largesrc="assets/images/brewery/brewcrewmain.png" data-title="Brewery Database" data-role="<p class=role>User Research, Database Design</p>" data-description="<p class=titlep>Summary</p>
							<div class=project-text>
							For the final project in my Database Management course, I and three other students created a database-driven brewery website. The Brew Crew site, constructed using PHP and a MySQL database, provides information about breweries in Washington, California, Texas and Oregon. Users can access brewery information by searching for location, beer type or brewery name, allowing users with a variety of goals to easily find the information they need. The site also includes basic information about common beer types that can be used for reference. Breweries listed on the site can obtain a username and password that allows them to login and edit, update or delete the beer selections listed under their brewery information.
						<p class=titlep>Process</p>
						We started the project by gathering information about breweries from various sources. We then determined which information was consistently provided for all breweries and began the database design process by creating an entity relationship diagram.  
						</div>
						<figure><img src=assets/images/brewery/er-diagram.png><figcaption>ER Diagram illustrating tables within the brewery database.</figcaption></figure><br><br>
						The design has six entities, focused around a main entity, brewery. Because breweries have many beers, a separate entity was created for beer. Similarly, because a brewery could potentially have multiple tours and multiple addresses, address and tour were created as separate entities. The beer type entity contains beer types, each type assigned to beer. The method entity is related to the tour entity and describes the methods that could be taken to schedule a tour.
						The following table illustrates the attributes associated with each entity.<br><br>
						<figure><img src=assets/images/brewery/attribute-tables.png><figcaption>Database tables and attributes</figcaption></figure>
						<br><br>

						From there, we developed use cases and their associated queries that the website would support including finding brewery based on beer type, name and location. Other use cases, related to users with logins, included add a beer, edit availability of a beer and delete a beer.
						<br><br>
						Once the database design was completed, we populated our MySQL database using phpMyAdmin. 
						With the prototyping tool Balsamiq, we created low-fidelity wireframes depicting the structure of our site and a site map. <br><br><br>

						<br>Re-Design" data-largesrc="assets/images/fal/fal-home.png"data-role="<p class=role>User Research, Information Architecture</p><a class=linkbox href=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/fal>View Website</a>" data-description="<p class=titlep>Summary</p>In the summer of 2013, in preparation for its migration into Drupal, the University of Texas Fine Arts Library (FAL) website received an information architecture re-design. As the project's information architect, I was responsible for working closely with FAL stakeholders to develop the new architecture that satisfied the needs of both students and staff.<br>

						<br>
						<p class=titlep>Re-Design Goals</p>
						&#5156; Restructure global navigation to emphasize significance and increase findability of 3 major collections: Visual Resources Collection (VRC), Historic Music Recordings Collection (HMRC) and A/V Collection
						<br>
						&#5156; Create prominent access points to digital collections such as DASe, the VRC&#39;s image database, and the A/V streaming video collection
						<br>
						&#5156; Distinguish collection department pages from archival and general holdings, and create equal representation and consistency between collection department pages
						<br>
						&#5156; Restructure and update research guide content in accordance with Drupal-based research guide template
						<br>
						&#5156; Eliminate redundant general informaton found on UT libraries main page
						<br>
						&#5156; Implement new features such as library chat widget
						<br>
						<br><p class=titlep>Process</p>
						My role in the project began with an investigation of the existing site's content and structure. I conducted a heuristic evaluation and created a content inventory to familiarize myself with the content and to identify existing issues. Using Google Analytics, I was also able to determine page usage and viewing patterns. After these initial steps, a meeting was held with the stakeholders from the Fine Arts Library to discuss what changes were desired, which portions of the site they felt were working, and which portions they found problematic.Using site statistics and data provided by the stakeholders, I created a rough wireframe using Axure that became increasingly more refined and detailed as the design process continued. <br><br>
						A large portion of the re-design was concentrated around the creation of pages for the FAL&#39;s three major collections: the Visual Resource Collection (VRC), the Historic Music Recordings Collection (HMRC) and the A/V Collection. These collections are distinct from the FAL&#39;s general holdings and special collections: they are departments within the FAL, contain their own staff and offer special services to students.  

						<figure><img src=assets/images/fal/vrc.png><figcaption>Mockup for Visual Resources Collection landing page</figcaption></figure> <br><br>

						<p>For each collection, I worked closely with the respective staff and subject librarians to determine each department&#39;s unique services and resources. Because many of the collections did not have distinct pages prior to the re-design, a single access point for each department was nonexistent; rather, information about each collection was scattered throughout various portions of the website. The re-design tackles this problem with a single, prominent access point from the global navigation for each collection. The consistent structure and aesthetic maintained across collection pages also helps to distinguish them from the general holdings.<br><br>
						Information relating to the library's services and holdings was consolidated under the &#34;About&#34; section. Content which was deeply embedded (and hard to find) in the original site was excavated and is now accessible through local navigation. The last phase of the project included transferring all legacy content into the new Drupal site which debuted in Fall 2013.<br><br>">

						data-description="<br>
						<p class=titlep>Summary</p>
						<div class=project-text>
						Recipeas is an Android application that integrates social media and recipe sharing to promote and support healthy eating. With the application, users create recipes, search recipes uploaded by others, and keep track of daily nutritional goals. The development process for the app, created as a final group project for my Information Architecture class, is outlined below.
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class=titlep>Research</p>
						We started the research process with a competitive analysis of existing applications for both Android and iOS to determine which features were already supported by apps similar to Recipeas. Through our analysis, we detected a need for a dynamic tool that would promote healthy eating while incorporating aspects of both food sharing and health and wellness applications. We then created three personas representing our target audience. These personas helped inform the design process and enabled us to focus on user needs and tasks. <br><br>
						<br>
						<br><br>
						<p class=titlep>Design</p>
						To begin the design process, we created a concept map illustrating the app's various components and associated user interactions. A content inventory was subsequently created, listing the content needed within each section of the application. To explore different IA possibilities, we created rough sketches before prototyping the application in Axure. Once a design was settled upon, we began building an interactive wireframe that supported four tasks: recipe creation, recipe retrieval, nutritional goal setting and wellness information lookup.
						<br><br>
						<p class=titlep>User Testing</p>
						User testing was conducted with a convenience sample of individuals ranging in age from 22 to 24 years. Participants were asked pre-test questions to determine their technological familiarity and were then instructed to perform four tasks using the wireframe. A member from the project team took notes on the participant&#39;s behavior during the test. A post-test interview was held during which subjects were asked 10 questions about their experience using Recipeas.
						<br><br>
						<p class=titlep>Iteration</p>
						After user testing was completed, we began the final process in the project: design modification. Using data gathered from user-testing, we modified our wireframe to increase task efficiency, eliminate ambiguity and support additional user-desired functionalities.<br><br>
