			<li>We talked a little bit about the browser quirk solved by something called a Clearfix. For more information, check out this CSS-Tricks article: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/">https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/</a> --and remember, if you're using floats and your parent element disappears, the pesky clearfix is probably the culprit. :U

		<strong>Homework</strong><em> &ndash; Oct. 8th Before Class </em>

		<ul>
			<li> Begin constructing a <a href="http://www.peramburkumar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Sitemap.jpg">sitemap</a>  of your portfolio. Be specific - instead of saying "Project", refer specifically to which project you'll be putting on each page. Think about your <strong> site's goal</strong> and how you would want to organize information to achieve that goal. <strong>Note: this is part of your portfolio project. Make sure to submit it via slackchat before class and be prepared to talk about your sitemap, why you chose to organize your content in this particular way and how it contributes to your site's goal. </strong></li>

			<li>Watch this video from Team Treehouse on Design Foundations. You'll have to sign up for a free trial. This site is similar to Code Academy, and has a lot of handy tutorials available for free. <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/design-foundations">Design Foundations Video</a>

			<li>Start compiling the content you'll want to include in your portfolio (images of projects, paragraphs about the projects, image captions etc.) We'll talk about how to design for a responsive experience next class and start translating our sitemaps into some sketches. Here's some example sketches for an app project I made while in school: <a href="img/design-sketches.png">Example Sketches</a>. You won't need to add color. </li>

		<h2 class="log__date">Oct. 13th &ndash; Wireframing</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>We'll talk about wireframing, it's purpose and the tools you can use to create wireframes.</li>

			<li>In groups, we'll do a wireframing exercise using photoshop and <a href="http://www.axure.com">Axure</a> to better understand how wireframes can be handy tools when re-designing or designing a website</li>

			<li><strong>Wireframing Task:</strong> Imagine that you are working on a group project for class. To help everyone understand what they should be working on, you want to create a website that will allow you create manage the tasks each person group member should be working on. The website should allow users to 1) Create new tasks and edit exiting ones 2) Assign tasks to specific people 3) Mark tasks as finished 4) Group tasks together.  </li>

			<li>Recently, a lot of cool wireframing and prototyping tools have been developed such as <a href="https://proto.io/">Proto.io</a>, <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a>, <a href="http://www.justinmind.com/free">Just in Mind</a>, <a href="http://www.axure.com/"> Axure</a>, and <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. Choosing one is really a matter of finding one you like and making sure it fits your needs. </li>

		</ul>	
		
		<hr class="log__homework-divider">
		<strong>Homework</strong><em> &ndash; Oct. 15th Before Class </em>
		<ul>
			<li>Start working on the wireframes for your own site using the sketches you've already created. <strong>Remember to create 3 display widths: mobile (320px), tablet (480px) and desktop (780+).</strong> Although the screen widths didn't matter in our sketches, your wireframes should be sized accurately. Here's an example of wireframes created for mobile, tablet and desktop experiences: <a href="http://www.dbt.co.uk/images/news/responsive_wireframe.jpg">responsive wireframes.</a> Here's another example shown in class of a <a href="http://cormy8.axshare.com/">medium fidelity wireframe</a> (notice there is some real content). For your wireframes, make sure to include as much real content as you can to get a sense of how it will actually lay out. The wireframes should grayscale (we'll worry about visual design elements such as typography and color later).<br><strong>These will be due Oct 20th.</strong> To submit, post your Invision link to the "portfolio-wireframes" slack channel.</li>	

			<li>Check out this <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/how-to-use-css3-media-queries-to-create-a-mobile-version-of-your-website/">article from Smashing Magazine</a> for an introduction to media queries.</li>

			<li>A cool thing: Axure, a wireframing tool that allows you to create interactive wireframes, offers free licenses to students and teachers. To get a free license, you'll need to submit proof of enrollment. Find out more about it here: <a href="http://www.axure.com/edu">Axure Education License</a>
			</li>
			
			<li>If you want a free UI kit for Photoshop (with pre-made buttons and such) for wireframing, Invision has a free one posted here: <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/do">http://www.invisionapp.com/do</a></li>

			<li>Some interactive wireframe examples shown in class: <a href="http://ogrh0h.axshare.com/">Low fidelity</a> (Recipeas Project) and <a href="http://cormy8.axshare.com/"> Medium fidelity</a> (Fine Arts Library).

		<h2 class="log__date">Oct. 15th &ndash; Coding with Media Queries</h2>
		<strong> Objective </strong> &ndash; <em>"How can I make my site responsive?" you might be wondering. The secret is media queries. We'll learn how they work, see a demo and start using them.</em>

		<div class="log__divider"> &#183; &#183; &#183;</div>	

		<h2 class="log__date">Oct. 20th &ndash; Guest Speaker: Annelise Bryda, UX/UI Designer<br> Note: Wireframes Due</h2>
		<strong> Objective </strong> &ndash; <em>Annelise will talk to use about visual design and how to set a direction for our sites. </em>

		<ul>
			<li>Go over competitive analysis, how to use a mood board to establish a visual direction.</li>

			<li>Start thinking how you want your site to appear visually. Think about how you will use some of the elements Annelise touched upon such as typography and color to give your site a purposeful look. What fonts will you use for body copy? What font will you use for headlines? What font sizes? Some web resources for fonts include: <a href="http:www.fontsquirrel.com">www.fontsquirrel.com</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google fonts</a> (which we've already looked at). 
		</ul>	

		<hr class="log__homework-divider">
		<strong>Homework</strong><em> &ndash; Oct. 22th Before Class </em>

		<ul>
			<li>Revise wireframes. You need to wireframe out each page for mobile (320px), tablet (768px) and desktop (1000px). Remember, these should be grayscale. Color is part of visual design. The purpose of a wireframe is to document the content you want to use, how it will appear at each screensize and how will the user navigate through the site (where will your pages link to? How will someone get to different sections once they're in another section?) You'll need to include real copy for credit. Create an <a href="http://invisionapp.com/">Invision account</a> to link the documents together. You'll only be able to create one project per free trial, so upload all your documents into one project. Pick one size (such as mobile) to link together using the hotspot feature. Check out this example here: <a href="https://invis.io/J24MHH0Z5">https://invis.io/J24MHH0Z5</a> (note: there's only one screensize here for the demo, you'rs will have mobile, tablet and desktop as mentioned above) <strong>Revised wireframes are due Oct. 29th. Submit the invision link to the Wireframe Revision slack channel</strong></li>
			<li> Check out these styleguides from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/styleguide">Starbucks</a>, <a href="http://www.priceline.com/styles/">Priceline</a>, <a href="http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/colours">Lonely Planet.</a> Pay attention to what elements are included. Buttons? Typography? Font sizes? Colors? </li>
			<li> Read Brad Frost's article on <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a>.

		<div class="log__divider"> &#183; &#183; &#183;</div>	

		<h2 class="log__date">Oct. 22th &ndash;Design Systems & Atomic Design Theory</h2>
		<strong> Objective </strong> &ndash; <em>Consistency is important when designing for the web and has a major impact on the user's experience. Establishing conventions that users can identify is critical, especially in larger sites. Creating a design system can help with this. It can also help you plan the look and feel of your site.  We'll learn about creating design systems and Brad Frost's theory of atomic design.</em>

		<ul>

		<li>Review some styleguides and discuss what's in them. What might be useful for our portfolio projects?</li>

		<li> Talk about front end frameworks such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. What are these? How would we use these?</li>

		<li> Go over the template you guys will use to create a design system for your portfolio. </li>

		<li> Quick media query exercise </li>

		</ul>

		<hr class="log__homework-divider">
		<strong>Homework</strong>

		<ul>
			<li> Continue to work on wireframe revisions </li>
			<li> Start working on your design system document - as your wireframes come together, and you start write real content you'll get a better understanding of what sort of fonts you'll want to use and where you'll want to use them.</li>

			<li><strong>Your design document should have at least:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Header fonts and sizes (px values and font names). Use www.fontsquirrel.com or Google web fonts to find web fonts.</li>
					<li>2. Body fonts and sizes (will your body copy get smaller for mobile?) Check out what others are doing.</li>
					<li>3. Color palette with hex codes and example swatches.</li>
					<li>4. Link colors and hover link colors</li>
				</ul> 	
				You can lay this out however you want to, but it should be one image. Check out this <a href="downloads/styleguide-example.png">example here.</a>
