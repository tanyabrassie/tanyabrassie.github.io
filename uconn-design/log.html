			<li>
				Discuss what the internet is, how browsers work and the basics needed to create a webpage. 
				If you don't already have them, please download: <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> &amp; <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari">Safari</a>.

		<hr class="log__homework-divider">
		<strong>Homework</strong> <em> &ndash; Due before class on Sept 8th</em>
		<ul>

			<li>
				Finish marking up your "About Me" pages. Make sure to include an image, a list, a paragraph and a link. Post the URL in our slack chat for credit. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Watch <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-LceTK/0/1">"Build your own webpage"</a>, "<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-y2Yjd/0/1"><abbr>HTML</abbr> Basics II"</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-9x6JW/0/1">"Social Networking Profile"</a> on codecademy. Please send a screenshot showing that you've competed each of these courses.
			</li>
		
			<li>
				Spend at least a half hour using the web inspector to see how various websites are coded. Look at the <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAwNxhnTtURMdJyTFPkXwuaHGZUvSCe_NQo"><abbr>HTML</abbr> and the <abbr>CSS</abbr></a>. Inspect the "About Me" page we built together, inspect this site and big name sites like <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>, <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.target.com/">Target</a>, etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				Look at the design (typeface, colors, contrast, balance) for each of <a href="http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/">Aesops fables rendered with google fonts</a>. As you're looking, think about what typefaces you might want to use and how you would like to design your "about me" page.
			</li>
			<li>
				<abbr><strong>FYI</strong></abbr>: there will be a short quiz on Sept. 15 in class on the tags we have used so far, so study up. Revisit the Codeacdemy tutorials if necessary.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Note: </strong>We've learned about a few <attr>HTML</attr> tags so far. There are many more available to us, some we will cover and some we will not. It's good to be aware of what tags are in the language so that you can always use the appropriate tag for the content. Check out a full list to <attr>HTML</attr> tags <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">here</a>. Please take note of the descriptions which tell you when and why to use each tag.

			</li>
			<li> <strong>Cool Resource Alert</strong> &ndash; If you need some dummy content, the Lorum Ipsum generator at <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a> is a great tool to quickly generate which allows you to generate blocks of gibberish latin text. I used it to create the block of gibberish used in my mockup above. 
			</li>

			<li><strong>Cool Resource Alert Part II</strong> &ndash; If you want to add some unicode characters to your website such as &#9742;, 	
			&#10084;, or even &#9973; or &#8611;, check out the <a href="http://unicode-table.com/en/">Unicode Character Table site</a>, which will show you the symbol and html code you can paste into your HTML document.

			<li> CSS Resets, what are they? What do they do? How do I use them? Here's an article that eliminates some of this mystery: <a href="http://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/">http://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/</a>

			<li>Some of you used tables in your About Me page. This isn't considered best practice for a variety of reasons. For an explanation of the downfalls of the HTML table check out this article from Smashing Magazine: 
			<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/from-table-hell-to-div-hell/">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/from-table-hell-to-div-hell/</a>

			<li>We talked a little bit about the browser quirk solved by something called a Clearfix. For more information, check out this CSS-Tricks article: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/">https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/</a> --and remember, if you're using floats and your parent element disappears, the pesky clearfix is probably the culprit. :U

		<ul>
			<li> Begin constructing a <a href="http://www.peramburkumar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Sitemap.jpg">sitemap</a>  of your portfolio. Be specific - instead of saying "Project", refer specifically to which project you'll be putting on each page. Think about your <strong> site's goal</strong> and how you would want to organize information to achieve that goal. <strong>Note: this is part of your portfolio project. Make sure to submit it via slackchat before class and be prepared to talk about your sitemap, why you chose to organize your content in this particular way and how it contributes to your site's goal. </strong></li>

Here's some example sketches for an app project I made while in school: <a href="img/design-sketches.png">Example Sketches</a>. You won't need to add color. </li>
