		<h2>About Me Project (100 pts) &ndash; Due Sept. 17th</h2>
		<p>To get acquainted with one another, please write 5 short phrases about yourself. These can be things you like, a mention of where you grew up, something you do or don't believe, a phobia, something no one else knows about you, etc. Be creative!</p>
		<p>We are going to use these phrases to begin to explore HTML, and to build our first webpages together!</p>
		<p>You can see 5 phrases I wrote about myself <a href="http://tanyabrassie.github.io/uconn-design/assignment-about/tanya-v1.html">here</a>. This page was written in <abbr>HTML</abbr>. HTML is used to identify and display content, not to style it, that's why it looks so boring. <!-- <a href="http://brianmccormack.github.io/uconn-design1/about-v2.html">Here</a> is what this page can look like with just a little bit of <abbr>CSS</abbr> applied.</p> -->
		<p>Your final About Me page will have <em>at minimum</em> a photo, 5 short phrases about you, a paragraph and a link. All of these should be styled with <abbr>CSS</abbr> located in a separate style sheet. If you want to add more, feel free! We'll look at examples of About Me pages in class for inspiration. 
		<p class="projects__last-p"><em>To complete the project, push the finished code to your github and post the link to your About Me page to our slack chat in the <a href="https://uconn-webdesign.slack.com/messages/aboutmepage/">"aboutmepage" channel.</a></em></p>
		<p>An example finished About Me page can be seen <a href="http://tanyabrassie.github.io/portfolio/aboutme.html">here.</a></p>

		<h2>Resume Project (150 pts) &ndash; Final Due <strike>Oct. 1</strike> Oct. 6</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Design a first draft of your resume making conscious use of the basic design principles. To submit, send the file to me via slack chat before class. <strong>Due Sept. 22 (25 pts)</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				After discussing some best practices when <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/the-art-of-the-design-critique" target="_blank">giving</a> or <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/critiquing-design-with-designers" target="_blank">receiving</a> feedback, we will critique our classmates' resumes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Based on feedback, we will iterate on our designs, creating two more resume where we will further experiment with the principals of design discussed in class. These second versions are due in class Sept. 27th along with a one to two paragraph (4-6 sentences each) explaining the reason for the design changes and how they make use of the basic design principles. To submit, send the file to me via slack chat before class. <strong> Due Sept. 24th. (50 pts)</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				Students will present their updated resume designs, discussing their thought process and how they applied the core design principals we've discussed for each iteration. They will solicit feedback from the class to understand what is working and where there are areas for improvement.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will run through a live coding demonstration to surface any hurdles you might face when developing your own resume.
			</li>
			<li>
				After settling on a single resume design, students will be responsible for building their own resumes with <abbr>HTML</abbr> &amp; <abbr>CSS</abbr>. To submit, publish to github in in your portfolio folder. Submit the github link to me in slack chat. </li>

					</li>

				<strong>Make sure your code is saved in your portfolio folder. You should have a "resume.html" document as well as a separate stylesheet in your css folder named "resume-styles.css". Push these updates to your Github page. Submit the link to your final version to me through slack chat before class (not during!) on Oct. 1st otherwise late penalties will apply. :U </strong>

		<strong>Bonus Points:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><em>How can it make money?</em><br>If in-app purchases are available, what are they and how to they enhance the experience</li>
			<li><em>Plan for repeat engagement</em><br>Consider how you might use push notifications or email marketing to keep customers coming back</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Process</strong>		
		<ol>
			<li>Diverge &mdash; Brainstorm ideas / app research &amp; inspiration <em>- 15 minute (individual exercise)</em></li>
			<li>Converge &mdash; Choose your best ideas (2 max) and write a quick pitch that you will give to your team to explain what the app is &amp; does.<em>- 10 minutes (individual exercise)</em></li>
			<li>Pitch idea(s) to team members <em>- 20 minutes</em></li>
			<li>Team vote / refine idea <em>- 10 minutes</em></li>
			<li>Diverge &mdash; Sketch the app screens <em>- 10 minute (individual exercise)</em></li>
			<li>Converge &mdash; Present sketches to team for alignment <em>- 15 minutes</em></li>
			<li>Refine sketches / wireframes &amp; write a paragraph description for the app store describing what your product is / does</li>
			<li>Use the app <a href="https://popapp.in/" target="_blank">Prototyping on Paper</a> to stitch together the interaction through the app.</li>
			<li>Post the url to your clickable prototype to <!-- <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cga3v080ckpktgj8fsk62cm79r8" target="_blank">this google event</a>, --> to slack including your paragraph description and the names of each of your team members.</li>
