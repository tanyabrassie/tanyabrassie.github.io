					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Making Icons</h2>
					<p class="work__explanation__paragraph">This year I was exposed to a terrible daily ritual practiced by many in the Northeast: the commute. In my former life as a Texan, I could hop on my bicycle and be anywhere worthwhile in 30 minutes tops. Where I came from, highways are unclogged and straight to the point--none of this backed-up, squiggly nonesense. As I took up the practice of commuting, and started to realize how many life minutes were wasted per day trying to transport myself places, I grew forlorn and anxious. When I looked around the train full of robotic, Dockers-clad businessmen, sleeping(/recharging?) or just staring off at things, I wondered if it was merely a matter of time before I took up the same habits.</p>

					 <p class="work__explanation__paragraph">But then(!) I had a plan: I would make one icon a day on the train to improve my illustration skills. I've always been very impressed by the work people post on Dribbble and wanted to level up. I've also heard about all the awesome things SVGs are capable of and wanted to see for myself. Starting out, I made anything I wanted but then tried to make themed sets.</p>

					 <p class="work__explanation__paragraph">I also wanted to improve my animation skills. I had heard about Velocity.js and thought it seemed cool to tinker around with using the SVG icons I created. I'm not that familiar with javascript, and mostly just use CSS animations, so this seemed like a good starting point.</p> 
 
					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Connecticut Commute Icon Set</h2>
					<p class="work__explanation__paragraph">This collection chronicles my morning routine and was the first set I finished. <a href="http://www.tanyabrassie.com/projects/commuter/sample.html">See the animated version</a> I made with velocity.js.

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Presidential Mansions</h2>
					<p class="work__explanation__paragraph">Around President's Day, while I was eating lunch, I had the idea of illustrating all the historical presidential mansions. These were pretty time consuming, so I only made it through four. Also, as it turns out, most of the presidential mansions are not that spectacular looking (e.g. the John Adams Peacefield house) and probably wouldn't make appealing icons.</p>

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Summer Icon Set</h2>
					<p class="work__explanation__paragraph">Hip Hip Hooray! I survived my first winter and made it through to see sunlight past 5pm. In celebration, I made this set.</p>
					<img class="work__image--main" src="../assets/images/icons/summer-set.png">

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Camping Set</h2>
					<p class="work__explanation__paragraph">Just your everyday camping essentials. No backstory here.</p>
					<img class="work__image--main" src="../assets/images/icons/camping.png">

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Random Appliance Set</h2>
					<p class="work__explanation__paragraph">Initially, I just wanted to make a Toledo scale since Toledo scales are very nice looking, if you've ever seen one. Then I started making all sorts of old things.</p>

					<h2 class="work__explanation__title">Some Crummy Christmas Icons (and some OK ones)</h2>
					<p class="work__explanation__paragraph">Some of my early icons. These are almost too crummy to post, but I'll do it anyways.</p>
